This repository is a proof of concept for one page application with Angular.js frontend and Rails backend.

It uses Yeoman and Grunt for JavaScript concatenation and minification. Backend is based on Rails part of [shareup-embedded](https://github.com/szyablitsky/shareup-embedded) and stripped to API only. User authorization is implemented on Rails side with Devise. All user interaction is done on frontend with Angular.js.
